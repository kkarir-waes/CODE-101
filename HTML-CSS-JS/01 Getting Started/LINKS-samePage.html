      He is best known for works such as <i>"Treasure Island"</i>,

      Born and educated in Edinburgh, Stevenson suffered from serious bronchial
      trouble for much of his life, but continued to write prolifically and
      travel widely in defiance of his poor health. As a young man, he mixed in
      London literary circles. In 1890, he settled in Samoa where, alarmed at
      increasing European and American influence in the South Sea islands, his
      writing turned away from romance and adventure fiction toward a darker
      realism.

      He died in his island home in 1894 at age 44. A celebrity in his lifetime,
      Stevenson's critical reputation has fluctuated since his death, though
      today his works are held in general acclaim. In 2018 he was ranked, just
      behind Charles Dickens, as the 26th-most-translated author in the world

      Lighthouse design was the family's profession; Thomas's father (Robert's
      grandfather) was civil engineer Robert Stevenson, and Thomas's brothers
      (Robert's uncles) Alan and David were in the same field.[6] Thomas's
      maternal grandfather Thomas Smith had been in the same profession.
      However, Robert's mother's family were gentry, tracing their lineage back
      to Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of Inchrye in Fife in the
      fifteenth century.[7] His mother's father Lewis Balfour (1777–1860) was a
      minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton,[8] and her siblings
      included physician George William Balfour and marine engineer James
      Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his
      maternal grandfather's house. "Now I often wonder what I inherited from
      this old minister," Stevenson wrote. "I must suppose, indeed, that he was
      fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained
      that either of us loved to hear them.

      In September 1857, Stevenson went to Mr Henderson's School in India
      Street, Edinburgh, but because of poor health stayed only a few weeks and
      did not return until October 1859. During his many absences, he was taught
      by private tutors. In October 1861, he went to Edinburgh Academy, an
      independent school for boys, and stayed there sporadically for about
      fifteen months. In the autumn of 1863, he spent one term at an English
      boarding school at Spring Grove in Isleworth in Middlesex (now an urban
      area of West London). In October 1864, following an improvement to his
      health, he was sent to Robert Thomson's private school in Frederick
      Street, Edinburgh, where he remained until he went to university.[22] In
      November 1867, Stevenson entered the University of Edinburgh to study
      engineering.

      The canoe voyage with Simpson brought Stevenson to Grez-sur-Loing in
      September 1876, where he met Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne (1840–1914), born
      in Indianapolis. She had married at age 17 and moved to Nevada to rejoin
      husband Samuel after his participation in the American Civil War. Their
      children were Isobel (or "Belle"), Lloyd and Hervey (who died in 1875).
      But anger over her husband's infidelities led to a number of separations.
      In 1875, she had taken her children to France where she and Isobel studied
      art.[45] By the time Stevenson met her, Fanny was herself a magazine
      short-story writer of recognized ability

      In June 1888, Stevenson chartered the yacht Casco and set sail with his
      family from San Francisco. The vessel "plowed her path of snow across the
      empty deep, far from all track of commerce, far from any hand of
      help."[71] The sea air and thrill of adventure for a time restored his
      health, and for nearly three years he wandered the eastern and central
      Pacific, stopping for extended stays at the Hawaiian Islands, where he
      became a good friend of King Kalākaua. He befriended the king's niece
      Princess Victoria Kaiulani, who also had Scottish heritage. He spent time
      at the Gilbert Islands, Tahiti, New Zealand and the Samoan Islands.

      On 3 December 1894, Stevenson was talking to his wife and straining to
      open a bottle of wine when he suddenly exclaimed, "What's that?", then
      asked his wife, "Does my face look strange?", and collapsed.[2] He died
      within a few hours, at the age of 44, probably of a cerebral haemorrhage.
      The Samoans insisted on surrounding his body with a watch-guard during the
      night and on bearing him on their shoulders to nearby Mount Vaea, where
      they buried him on a spot overlooking the sea on land donated by British
      Acting Vice Consul Thomas Trood.[96] Stevenson had always wanted his
      Requiem, written by Stevenson himself, inscribed on his tomb

    <h1 id="poem" style="text-align: center">"A Railway Carriage"</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">Robert Louise Stephenson 1885</h2>

    <pre style="text-align: center">
	Faster than fairies, faster than witches,
	Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;
	And charging along like troops in a battle,
	All through the meadows the horses and cattle:

	All of the sights of the hill and the plain
	Fly as thick as driving rain;
	And ever again, in the wink of an eye,
	Painted stations whistle by.

	Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,
	All by himself and gathering brambles;
	Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;
	And there is the green for stringing the daisies!
	
	Here is a cart run away in the road
	Lumping along with man and load;
	And here is a mill and there is a river:
	Each a glimpse and gone for ever!
