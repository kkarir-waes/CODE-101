            <h3>Early Years</h3>
            <p>
              Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England.
              He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in
              mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a
              proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yesâ€“no questions
              can never be answered by computation. He defined a Turing machine
              and proved that the halting problem for Turing machines is
              undecidable.

            <h3>Academic Years</h3>
            <p>
              In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at
              Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked
              for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park,
              Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence.
              For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for
              German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of
              techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including
              improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method, an
              electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma
              machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted
              coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers
              in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.
