### TEST ZONE

This repository is for things I'm working on at the moment.

Feel free to have a look a the code and if you have any questions or suggestion the do gwt in touch.

The code in here is "Work in Progress". So it isn't finished and probably doesn't work as it should. Use it but I make no promises..hehe.
